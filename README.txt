Known limitations:
-   Criteria used for choosing best_test and best_strategy
-   Best_sequence of test condition: the program completes the sequence until no tests are left
-   Strategies are associated with PCBs, not with their components
-   Association between defects and components or PCB types
-   The program does not use historical data stored in the database to influence future decisions
-   Criteria used for updating probabilities based on the outcomes of a test
